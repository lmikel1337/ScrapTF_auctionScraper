# ScrapTF_auctionScraper
Scrapes scrap.tf auctions and provides links to relevant bp.tf classifieds listings.

# How to use:
1. Run main.py
2. Enter the auction ID('https://scrap.tf/auctions/auction_ID')

#Note: you might need to install bf4(beautifulsoup4 module), though I'm not certain about that.
To do that if on windows:
1. Launch the command prompt by searching "cmd".
2. Navigate to project dir by enter "cd PATH_TO_THE_DIR". If you need to change drives, enter "DRIVE_NAME:" first.
3. enter "import bf4"
